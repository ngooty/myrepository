All code files are written by me for my own practice and demo puprose for my Data Science with R and Python Training. 
I have not put any of project code files which are either Confidential or having clients' obligations or Intellectual Properties. 
Let me know if you find any errors or mistake in the code. I will be glad to correct it and upload the right code. 
Request whoever download/import/clone these codefiles to provide credits wherever required.
